## Notes

- FR-003 was resolved as direct same-request result delivery on 2026-07-13;
  Phase 1 does not persist or replay Invocation Results.
- FR-027 records that strict duplicate-member scanning preserves every legal
  JSON number token and leaves declared ranges to typed fields or capability
  schemas.
